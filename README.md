## 🧠 Problem-Solving-Journey-in-C++

Welcome!

This is a personal documentation of my journey into problem solving using C++.

I’m starting from the ground up — building a solid foundation first.

I chose a course that teaches core programming concepts with practical applications,

so I can truly understand what each line of code means and how to write it properly.

**Note:**

This first phase does *not* involve algorithms or data structures.

The focus here is on mastering the fundamentals — variables, conditionals, loops, functions, arrays, and strings — through practical problem solving.

Whenever paid resources aren’t accessible, I rely on high-quality free content — especially from YouTube and trusted open-source tutorials. The important thing is staying consistent and learning with intention.

Once that foundation is in place, I'll be diving into structured problem solving.

One last note on the otherhand start with course paid or not (on youtube or other platform)

### 🧩 My approach:

- I use an AI assistant as a learning partner, helping me think through problems and understand deeper concepts.
- I focus on solving problems with **quality and understanding**, not just quantity.
- I recommend turning off **code auto-complete** in your coding environment — this forces your brain to engage with the syntax and logic.

If you're just starting too, feel free to follow along — this is a journey of growth, not perfection.
